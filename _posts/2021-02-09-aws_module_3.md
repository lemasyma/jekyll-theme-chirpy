# Section 1: AWS Global Infrastructure
* The **AWS Global Infrastructure** is designed and built to deliver a *flexible, reliable, scalable* and *secure* cloud computing environmnent with high-quality **global network performance**

## AWS Region

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
An AWS Region is a geographical area
* Data replication across Regions is controlled by you
* Communication between Regions uses AWS backbone network infrastructure
</div>

* Each region provides full redundancy and connectivity to the network
* A region typically consists of two or more *Availability Zone*

## Selecting a Region

* Might be legal requirements
    * Local laws can restrict the Region
    * Ex: European Union
* Latency
    * Can test with Cloud Ping
* Not all AWS services are available depending on the region


## Availability Zones
* Each *Region* has multiple Availabiity Zones
* Each *Availability Zone* is fully isolated partition of the AWS infrastructure
    * 69 Availability Zones worldwide
    * Availability Zones consist of discrete *data centers*
        * Usually 3
    * They are designed for fault isolation
    * They are interconnected with other Availability Zones by using high-speed private networking
        * Dedicated fiber
    * You choose your Availability Zones
    * **AWS recommends replicating data and resources across Availability Zones** for resiliency
        * Protected for tornadoes, lightning, earthquakes...

## AWS data centers
* AWS data centers are *designed for security*
* Data centers are where the data resides and data processing occurs
* Each data has redundant power, networking and connectivity, and is housed in a separate facility
* A data center typically has 50,000 to 80,000 physical servers

AWS uses custom netowrking equipment source from multiple ODMs.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
ODM: Original Device Manufacturers
Design and manufacture product based on specifications from a second company. The second company rebrand the products for sale.
</div>

## Points of Presence
* AWS provides a global network of 187 *Points of Presence* locations
* Consists of 176 **edge locations** and 11 **Regional edge caches**
* Used with Amazon CloudFront
    * A global Content Delivery Network (CDN) that delivers content to end users with *reduced latency*
* Regional edge caches used for content with infrequent access

## AWS infrastructure features
* Elasticity and scalability
    * Elastic infrastructure; dynamic adaption of capacity
    * Scalable infrastructure; adpats to accomodate growth
* Fault-tolerance
    * Continues operating properly in the presence of a failure
    * Built-in redundancy of components
* High availability
    * High level of operational performance
    * Minimize downtime
    * No human intervention

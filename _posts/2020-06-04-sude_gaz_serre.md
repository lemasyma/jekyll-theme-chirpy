# Introduction to GreenHouse Gases (GHG) emission calculation
*What are the **main** green house gases?*
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert" markdown="1">
* Carbone Dioxyde
* Methane
* N2O
</div>

# Methodologies to compute GHG emissions
* GHG protocol (US methodology)
* ISO 14064-1
* Bilan Carbone (french methodology)

# Designing a carbon footprint
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
* Organizational boundaries
    * In a **control approach** you account for all GHG emissions from facilities over which you have a financial or operational control
    * In a **equality share approach** you would account for GHG emissions in proportion to the percentage ownership over the facility
* Base year
    * have to set a **base year** so you can follow the emission trend
* Operational boundaries
    * have to decide which emissions to report
    * Direct emissions (*scope 1*) and energy indirect emissions (*scope 2*) are mandatory
    * Reporting of other indirect emissions (*scope 3*) is not
</div>

## Emission scopes
* Scope 1 = Direct energy sources
    * Any source activity from an asset controlled by the organization
    * *Ex : electricity to light the office*
* Scope 2 = Indirect energy sources
    * Any source activity not controlled by the organization that generates energy used by the organization
    * *Ex : a car used by an employee*
* Scope 3 = Other indirect sources
    * Any non-energy related sources not controlled by the organization that impacts the organization

## Monitoring Emissions
* Data collection
* Data processing
* Organisation
    * project management
    * people involved
    * etc.

## Identify sources
* Activity that impacts organization's operation and results in the emission of greenhouse gases
* Examples
    * Natural gas heating
    * Water use
    * Business travel
    * Air conditionning
    * Waste sent to municipal landfill...

## Collect data and define units to use
* Natural gas heating
    * m3
    * Gj
    * ft3
    * Ccf
* Electricity
    * kWh
    * Gj

## Emission factors
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
An **emission factor** is a ratio corresponding to the amount of greenhouse gases emitted as a result of a given unit of activity
</div>
### Example - Natural Gas
* GWP : a ration denoting the effect of a quantity of a greenhouse gas on climate change with an equal quantity of carbon dioxyde usually expressed over a 100 year period
* Carbon dioxyde always has a GWP of 1
* Result are expressed in Carbon Dioxyde equivalent (g/kg/t C02e)

| Natural Gas | Emission | GWP | t C02e |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| C02/m3   | ~27t  | 1 | 27 |
| CH4/m3   | 0.0005t | 25 | 0.0125 |
| N20/m3   | 0.0005t | 298 | 0.149 |

## Implement strategies / actions to reduce
* Computing is necessary
* the **most** important being to understand what to reduce and which actions are needed

# GreenIt or Sustainable ICT
> We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them
> 
> -- <cite> Albert Einstein</cite>

## General statemets - Shift Project 2018
* Digital consumption as forecast is not sustainable
* Energy intensity of digital industry is in continuous growth
* No digital impact foreseen on worldwide productivity nor growth
* It is still possible to move ot a more sober digital world

## Digital energy consumption
In France : Digital Energy Consumption represents $12\%$ of total energy consumption.

## GHG emissions : $2,5\%$ in 2013 to $4\%$ in 2020

# Section 1: Load Balancing
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
* Distributes incoming app or network traffic across multiple targets in a single or multiples AZ
* Scales your load balance as traffic to your aapp changes over time

</div>

## Types of loads balancers

## How Elastic Loads Balancing works
* With Application Load Balncers and Network Load Balancers, you **register targets in traffic to the target groups**
* With Classic Load Balancers, you *register instance with the load balancer*
* Load balancer performs health checks to monitor health of registered targets

## Elastic Load Balancing use cases
* High available and fault-tolerant app
* Containerized app
* Elasticity and scalability
* VPC
* Hybrid environments
* Incoke Lambad functions over HTTP(S)

## Load balancer monitoring
* **Amazon CloudWatch metrics**
    * Used to verify that the system is performing as expected and creates an alarm to initiate an action if a metric goes outside an acceptable range
* **Access logs**
    * Capture detailed information about requests sent to your load balancer
* **AWS CloudTrail logs**
    * Capture the who, what, when, and where of API interactions in AWS services

# Section 2: Amazon CloudWatch
## Monitoring AWS resources
To use AWS efficiently, you need insight into your AWS resources:
* How do you know when you should *launch more Amazon EC2 instances ?*
* Is your *app's performance or availability* being affected by a lack of sufficient capacity ?
* How much of your infrastructure is actually *being used* ?

## Amazon CloudWatch
* Monitors
    * AWS resources
    * App that run on AWS
* Collect and track
    * Standard metrics
    * Custom metrics
* Alarms
    * Send notifications to an Amazon SNS topic
    * Perform Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling or Amazon EC2 actions
* Events
    * Define rules to match changes in AWS environment and route these events to one or more target functions or streams for processing

## CloudWatch alarsm
* Create alarms basde on
    * Static threshold
    * Anomlay detection
    * Metric math expression
* Specify
    * Namespace
    * Metric
    * Statistic
    * Period
    * Conditions
    * Additional configuration
    * Actions

# Section 3: Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
## Why is scaling important ?
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
Scaling is the ability ot increase of decrease the compute capacity of your app. 
</div>

![](https://i.imgur.com/yLp2cmb.png)
* First graph: unused capacity on most days of the week, not cost optimized
* Second graph: under capacity on certain days

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" markdown="1">
Automatic capacity scaling is necessary to support the fluctuating demands for service.
</div>

## Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
* Hels you maintaint app
* Enables you to automatically add or remove EC2 instances according to conditions that you define
* Detects impaired EC2 instances and unhealthy app, and replaces the instances without your intervention
* Provides several scaling options
    * Manual
    * Scheduled
    * Dynamic (on-demand)
    * Predictive

## Typical weekly traffic at Amazon.com

## November traffic to Amazon.com

## Auto Scaling groups
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
An **Auto Scaling group** is a collection of EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management.

## Implementing dynamic scaling

## AWS Auto Scaling
* Monitors you app and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost
* Provides a simple, powerful user interface that enables you to build scaling plans for resources, including
    * Amazon EC2 instances and Spot Fleet
    * Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Tasks
    * Amazon DynamoDB tables and indexes
    * Amazon Aurora Replicas

# Section 1: Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
## Storage
* Provides persistent block storage volumes with Amazon EC2 instances
* Called non-volatile storage
* Replicated within AZ

## AWS Storage options: block storage vs object storage
*What if you want to change one character in a 1-GB file ?*
![](https://i.imgur.com/hHdghtV.png)

## Amazon EBS
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
Amazon EBS enables you to **create individual storage volumes** and **attach them** to an Amazon EC2 instance
</div>
* Amazon EBS offers block-level storage
* Volumes are automatically replicated within its AZ
* Can be backed up automatically to Amazon S3 through snapshots
* Uses include
    * Boot volumes and storage for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance
    * Data storage with a file system
    * Database hosts
    * Enterprise app

## Amazon EBS volume types
![](https://i.imgur.com/o9kJ5jj.png)

## Amazon EBS
* Snapshots
    * Point-in-time snapshots
    * Recreate a new volume at any time
* Encryption
    * Encrypted Amazon EBS volumes
    * No additional cost
* Elasticity
    * Increase capacity
    * Change to different types

## Volumes, IOPS and pricing
1. Volumes
    * Amazon EBS volumes persist independently from the instance
    * All volume types are charged by the that is provisioned per month
2. IOPS
    * General Purpose SSD
        * Charged by the amount that you provision in GB per month until storage is released
    * Magnetic
        * Charged by the number of requests to the volume
    * Provisioned IOPS SSD
        * Charged by the amount that you provision in IOPS (multiplied by the percentage of days that you provision for the month
3. Snapshots
    * Added cost of Amazon EBS snapshots to Amazon S3 is per GB-month of data stored
4. Data transfer
    * Inbound data transfer is free
    * Outbound data transfer accross Regions incurs charges

# Section 2: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
## Storage
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
Amazon S3 is **object-level storage**.
</div>

* If want to change part of a file, must do the change and repload the entier file

## Amazon S3 overview
* Data stored as objects in buckets
* Virtually unlimited storage
    * Single object is limited to 5 TB
* Designed for 11 9s of durability
* Granular access to bucket and objects
* Data private per default
* Can set up notification
    * When object is added
    * When object is deleted

## Amazon S3 stroage classes
Amazon S3 offers a range of object-level storage classes that are designed for different use cases
* Amazon S3 standard
    * High availability
    * High durability
    * Perfomance
    * Frequently access data
* Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering
    * Optimize cost
    * Moving data to the most cost-effective access tier
    * long-live data with unpredictable access pattern
* Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Amazon S3 Standard-IA)
    * Data accessed less frequently
    * long-term storage
* Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (Amazon S3 One Zonw-IA)
    * Data accessed less frequently
    * Stores data in a single availbility zone
* Amazon S3 Glacier
    * Secure
    * Durable
    * low cost
    * data archiving
    * three retrieval options
        * min to hours
* Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive
    * Lowest cost
    * long-term detention
    * retrieved once or twice a year

## Amazon S3 bucket URLS (two styles)
To upload your data:
1. Create a **bucket** in an AWS Region
2. Upload almost any number of **objects** to the bucket

Bucket path-style URL endpoint:
`https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/bucket-name`

Bucket virtual-hosted-style URL endpoint
`https://bucket-name.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com`

## Data is redundantly stored in the Region
Prevent data loss

## Designed for seamless scaling
Amazon S3:
* automatically manage the storage
* scales to handle high volume of request
* billed for what you use

## Access the data anywhere
* AWS CLI
* AWS Management Console
* SDK

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" markdown="1">
Bucket names must be globally unique and DNS compliant: all lowercase, only letters, numbers and dashes
</div>

## Amazon S3 common scenarios
* Backup and storage
* Application hosting
* Media hosting
* Software

## Amazon S3 pricing
* Pay for what you use
    * GBs per month
    * Transfer OUT to other Regions
    * PUT, COPY, POST, LIST and GET requests
* You do not pay for
    * Transfers IN to Amazon S3
    * Transfers OUT from Amazon S3 to Amazon CloudFront or Amazon EC2 in the same region

## Amazon S3: Storage pricing
To estimate Amazon S3 costs:
1. **Types of storage classes**
    * Standard storage is for
        * 11 9s of durability
        * 4 9s of availability
    * S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S-IA) is for
        * 11 9s of durability
        * 3 9s of availaibility
2. **Amount of storage**
    * The number and size of objects
3. **Requests**
    * Number of requests (GET, PUT, COPY)
    * Type of requests
        * Different rates for GET requests
4. **Data transfer**
    * Pricing based on amount of data transferred ou of Amazon S3 Region
        * Data transfer in is free, but incur charges for data transferred out

# Section 3: Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)

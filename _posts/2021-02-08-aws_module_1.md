# Introduction
* Intro to cloud computing
* Advantages of cloud computing
* Introduction to AWS
* AWS Cloud Adoption Framework

# Section 1: Introduction to cloud computing
## What is cloud computing ?
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
**Cloud computing** is the *on-demand* delivery of compute power, database, storage applications, and other IT resources *via the internet* with *pay-as-you-go* pricing
</div>
## Infrastructure as software
Cloud computing enable you to **stop thinking of your infrastructure as hardware** and instead *think of it as software*.

In the traditional compute model:
* Infrastructure as hardware
* Hardware solutions
    * Require space, staff, physical security, planning, capital expenditure
    * Have a long hardware procurement cycle
    * Require you to provision capacity by guessing max peaks

Cloud computing model:
* Infrastructure as software
* Software solutions:
    * Are flexible
    * Can change more quickly, easily and cost-effectively than hardware solutions
    * Eliminate the undifferentiated heavy-lifting tasks

## Cloud service models

## Cloud computing deployement models
1. Cloud
2. Hybrid 
    * Between cloud and existing premises
3. On-premises (private cloud)
    * Dedicated resources

## Similarities between AWS and traditional IT

# Section 2: Advantages of the cloud
## Trade capital expense for variable expense
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
Capital expense = capex
</div>

## Massive economies of scale
Because of aggregate usage from all customers, AWS can achieve higher economies of scale and pass savings onto customers.
## Stop guessing capacity

## Increase speed and agility
*Weeks* between wanting resources and having resources to only *minutes*.
## Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
![](https://i.imgur.com/Se0V7wy.png)
## Go global in minutes
Can deploy applications in multiple places of the world

# Section 3: Introduction to AWS
## What are web services ?
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert" markdown="1">
A **web service** is any piece of software that makes itself availbale over the internet and uses *standardized format* such as XML or JSON fro the request and the response of an **API** interaction.
</div>
## What is AWS
* a *secure cloud platform* offering a broad set of global cloud-based products
* provides *on-demand access* to compute, storage, network, database, and other IT resources and management tools
* offers **fexibility**
* You pay **only** for the individual services you need, as long as you use them
* AWS services *work together* like Legos
 
## Services

## Choosing  a service
The service you select *depends on* your business goals and tech requirements.

## 3 ways to interact with AWS
* AWS management console
    * Easy-to-use graphical interface
* Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
    * Access to services by discrete commands or scripts
* Software Developement Kits (SDKs)
    * Acces services directly from your code

# Section 4: Moving to the AWS Cloud
## AWS Cloud Adoption Framework
AWS CAF provides guidance and best practices to help organizations build a comprehensive approach to cloud computing across the organization and throughout th IT lifecycle to *accelerate successful cloud adoption*

AWS CAF is organized into *six perspectives*
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
**Perspectives** consist of sets of capabilities.

</div>

## Six core perspectives
![](https://i.imgur.com/OplC7nK.png)

## Business perspectives
![](https://i.imgur.com/qnIjBiS.png)

> We must ensure that **IT is aligned with business needs**, and that IT investments can be traced to demonstrable business results - Business managers, finance managers, budget owners, and strategy stakeholders

## People perspectives
![](https://i.imgur.com/qW32FgW.png)

> We must prioritize **training, staffing and organizational changes** to build an agile organization - Human resources, staffing, and people managers

## Goverance perspective
![](https://i.imgur.com/F7tw2x6.png)

> We must ensure that **skills and processes align IT strategy and goals with business strategy and goals** so the organization can maximise the business value of its IT investments and minimize business risks. - CIO, program managers, business analysts and portgolio managers

## Platform perspective
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZehgzFL.png)

> We must **understand and communicate the nature of IT systems and their relationships**. We must be able to **describe the architecture of the target state environment** in detail. - CTO, IT managers and solutions architects

## Security perspective
![](https://i.imgur.com/qVZ0Ywx.png)

> We must ensure that the organization **meets its security obejctives** - CISO, IT security managers and IT security analysts

## Operations perspective
![](https://i.imgur.com/DqjVdNH.png)

> We align with and ssupport the operations of the business, and **define how day-to-day**, **quarter-to-quarter, and year-to-year business will be conducted** - IT operations manager and IT support managers

# Wrap-up
## Sample exam question
Why is AWS more economical than traditional data centers for applications with variable compute workloads ?
1. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) costs are billed on a monthly basis
2. Customers retain full administrative access to their Amazon ECE2 instances
3. Amazon ECE2 instances can be launched on-demand when needed
4. Customers can permantly run enough instances to handle peak workloads

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Answer</summary>

Keywords: **AWS more economical than traditional data centers**, indicate one of the 6 computing benefits and **variable** indicates need for flexibility

Answer: 3

# Section 7: Reliability and Availability
> "Everything fails, all the time" - Werner Vogels, CTO, Amazon.com

## Reliability
* A measure of your system's *ability to provide functionality* when desired by the user
* *System* includes: hardware, software, firmware 
* *Probability* that your entire system will function as intended for a specified period
* *Mean time between failures (MTBF)* = total time in serviceumber of failures

## Understanding reliability metrics
![](https://i.imgur.com/EiRxJse.png)

## Availability
* Normal operation time / total time
* A percentage of uptime (ex: 99.9%) over time (ex: 1y)
* Number of 9s - 5 9s means 99.999% availability

## High availability
* System can withstand some measure of degradation while still remaining available
* Downtime is minimized
* Minimal human intervention is required

## Availability tiers
![](https://i.imgur.com/cVgSshs.png)

## Factors that influenc availability
* Fault tolerance
    * The *built-in redundancy* of an app compononents and its *ability to remain operational*
* Scalability
    * The ability of an app to *accomodate increases in capacity needs* without changing design
* Recoverability
    * The process, policies, and procedures that are related to *restoring service* after a catastrophic event

# Section 8: AWS Trusted Advisor
* *Online tool that provides real-time guidnace* to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices
* Looks at your *entire AWS enivronment* and gives you a real time recommendations in
    * Cost Optimization
        * eliminating unused resources
        * commitment to reserve capacity
    * Performance
        * checking service limit
        * service throughput
    * Security
        * improve security of the app by identifying gaps
        * permissions
        * increase availability and redundancy

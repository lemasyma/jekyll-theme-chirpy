# Assessment
* To upload before the presentation tomorrow
* We can do a video, just make sure it's available in Teams
* The difficult part is to find green it actions
* If people can't speak during the presentation because of thechnical issues, no problem : others can speak or video
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert" markdown="1">
Don't mix up the Green IT with corporate obligations. We should talk about the actions taken to reduce the impact on the environment.
</div>

There used to be a club called *Club Green IT*, good lead for a subject.

## SDG
* Put the SDG at the end of the presentation
    * We don't have to develop them, just do orally the presentation on the first part
* One sentence per SDG is enough
    * We are not asking for a report, just put bullet points

# GHG emissions
**What is the point of computing GHG emitted by a company ?**
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
To prepare an action plan to reduce them.
</div>

## Metal in IT
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" markdown="1">
China owns most of the rare earth production, they can choose to not provide it anymore.
</div>
We have to be careful about metals in IT, some resources are low and the price may rise.

## Average computer lifespan
* 1985 : 10 to 15 years (average lifespan of 10 years), easy to upgrade, fix, reuse and recycle
* 2007 : lifespan dropped to 2,5 years
    * launch of Windows Vista => most companies had to change equipment because the hardware couldn't support the new OS versions
    * same problem for MacOS
    * perfect example on how they did not consider that everyone had good enough hardware
* 2015 : 3 to 15 years (average lifespan of 5 years), impossible to upgrade, fix, reuse or recycle

## Impacts on the life cycle
*What are the impacts at each stage of the life cycle ?*
### Production
*What are the environmental impacts of the components ?*
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" markdown="1">
40 chemical components in a smartphone, including rare earth.
</div>
* Part of our electronic equipment are mined in unsanitary conditions and uses child labor => **confilct minerals**
* pollution
* high production rates

### Use
* Devices with various energy efficiency

### End of life
* 1,68 millions tons of electronic waste put on the market in 2015
    * 166 times the Eiffel Tower's weight
* 75% of electronical waste is out of the official radar
    * sent to illegal landfills (Ghana, Nigeria, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South America)

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert" markdown="1">
Production has the biggest impact on the environment.

# Section 1: Fundamentals of pricing
## AWS pricing model
Three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS:
1. Compute
    * Charged per hour/second
    * Varies by instance type
2. Storage
    * Charged typically per GB
3. Data transfer
    * Outbound is aggregated and charged
    * Inbound has no charge (with some exceptions)
    * Charged typically per GB

## How do you pay for AWS ?
![](https://i.imgur.com/Yl2gmmt.png)

## Pay for what you use
Pay only for the servuces that you consume, with no large upfront expenses
![](https://i.imgur.com/6Gup3ik.png)

## Pay less by using more
Realize volume-based discounts:
* **Savings** as usage increases
* **Tiered pricing** for services like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Elastic Book Store (Amazon EBS) or Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) $\rightarrow$ the more you use, the less you pay per GB
* Multiple storage service deliver **lower** storage costs based on needs

## Pay even less as AWS Grows
* AWS focuses on lowering cost of doing business
* This pratice results in AWS passing savings from economies of scale to you
* Since 2006, AWS has **lowered pricing 75** times (as of Septembre 2019)
* Future higher-performing resources replace current resources for no extra charge

## Custom pricing
* Meet varying needs through custom pricing
* Available for high-colume projects with unique requirements

## AWS Free Tier
Enables you to gain free hands-on experience with the AWS platform, products and services. Free for 1 year for new customers

## Services with no charge

# Module 2: Total cost of Ownership
## On-premises versus cloud
![](https://i.imgur.com/AcvyCRO.png)

## What is Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) ?
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" markdown="1">
**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** is the financial estimate to help identify direct and indirect costs of a system.
</div>

Why use TCO ?
* To compare the costs of running an **entire infrastructure environmnet of specific workload** on-premises versus on AWS
* To budget and **build the business case** for moving to the cloud

## TCO Consideration
![](https://i.imgur.com/RCOz6ty.png)

## On-premises versus all-in-cloud
You cloud cave up to **96 percent** a year by moving your infratstructure to AWS. Your 3-year total savings would be **\$159,913**
![](https://i.imgur.com/yaBYhZA.png)

## AWS Pricing Calculator
Use the **AWS Pricing Calculator** to:
* Estimate monthly costs
* Identify opportunities to reducse monthly costs
* Model your solutions before building them
* Explore price points and calculations behind your estimate
* Find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs
* Name your estimate and create name **groups** of services

## Reading an estimate
Your estimate is broken into:
* first 12 months total
* total upfront
* total monthly

## Additional benefit considerations
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
* Cloud Total Cost of Ownership: what will be spent to run the solution
* Return on Investement analysis (ROI): determine the value generated while considering savings $\rightarrow$ *soft* and *hard* benefits
</div>

|**Hard benefits**|**Soft benefits**|
|---|---|
|Reduced spending on compute, storage, networking, security|Reuses of service and applications that enabl you to define (and redefine solutions) by using the same cloud service|
|Reductions in hardware and softare purchases (capex)|Increased developer productivity|
|Reductions in operational costs, backup, and disaster recovery|Improved customer satisfaction|
|Reduction in operations personnel|Agile business processes that can quickly respond to new and emerging opportunities|
||Increase in global reach|

## Case study: Delaware North
Background:
* Growing global company with over 200 locations
* 500 million customers: \$3 billion USD annual revenue

Challenge:
* Meet demand to rapidly deploy new solutions
* Constantly upgrade aging equipment

Criteria:
* Have a broad solution to handle all workloads
* Be able to modify processes to improve efficiency and lower costs
* Eliminate busy work (such as patching software)
* Achieve a positive return on investment (ROI)

Solution:
* Move their on-premises data center to AWS
    * Eliminated 205 servers (90%)
    * Moved nearly all aplications to AWS
* Used 3-year Amazon ECE2 Reserved Instances

* a branch can have only one parent

## Key features and benefits
* Policy-base account management
* Group based account management
* APIs that automate account management
* Consolidate billing

## Security with AWS Organizations

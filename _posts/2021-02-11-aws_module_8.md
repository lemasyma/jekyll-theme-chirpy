# Section 1: Amazon Realtional Database Service (RDS)
## Unmnagade vs managed services
### Unmanaged
managed by you:
* Scaling
* Fault tolerance
* Availability

More fine-tune control

### Managed
built in the service:
* Scaling
* Fault tolerance
* Availability

Requires less configuration

## Challenges of relational databases
* Server maintenance and energy footprint
* Software installation and patches
* Database backups and high availability
* Limits on scalability
* Data security
* OS installation and patches

## Amazon RDS
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert" markdown="1">
Managed services that sets up and operates a relational database in the cloud
</div>

## Managed services responsabilities
You manage
* App opti

AWS manages:
* OS installation and patches
* Databse software installation and patches
* Database backups
* High availability
* Scaling
* Power and racking and stacking servers
* Server maintenance

## Amazon RDS DB instances

## Amazon RDS in a VPC
![](https://i.imgur.com/3rZrzcR.png)
* Select IP address range
* Subnets
* Configure routing and access control list

## High availability with Multi-AZ deployement
### 1
![](https://i.imgur.com/F6BPAb1.png)
* Automatically generates a standby copy in another AZ within the same VPC
* Enhanced availability

### 2

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" markdown="1">
If the main database instance fails, Amazon RDS automatically brings the standby instance online.
</div>

## Amazon RDS read replicas
Features
* Offers asynchronous replication
* Can be promoted to master if needed

Functionality
* Use for read-heavy database workloads
* Offload read queries

## Use cases
![](https://i.imgur.com/NipofB0.png)

## When to Use Amazon RDS

|Use Amazon RDS when your app requires|Do not use Amazon RDS when your app requires|
|-|-|
|Complex transactions or complex queries|Massive read/write rates|
|A medium to high query or write rate (Up to 30,000 IOPS)|Sharding due to high data size or throughput demands|
|No more than a single worker node or shard|Simple GET or PUT requests and queries that a NoSQL database can handle|
|High durability|Relational database managemnet (RDBMS) customization|

## Amazon RDS: Clock-hour billing and db characteristics
Clock-hour billing
* Resources incur charges when running

Databas characteristics
* Physical capacity
    * Engine
    * Size
    * Memory class

## Amazon RDS: DB purchase type and multiple DB instances
DB purcharse type
* On-demand isntances
    * Compute capacity by the hour
* Reserved Instance
    * Low, one-time, upfront paymenent for db instances that are reserved with a 1-year or 3-year term

Number of DB instances
* Provision multiple DB instance to handle peak loads

## Amazon RDS storage
Provisioned storage
* No charge
    * Bakcup storage up to 100% of db storage for an active db
* Charge (*GB/month*)
    * Backup storage for terminated DB instances

Additional storage
* Charge (*GB/month*)
    * Backup storage in addition to provisioned storage

## Amazon RDS: Deployement type and data transfer
Requests
* The number of input and output requests that are made to the db

Deployement type - storage and I/O vary, depending on whether you deploy to
* Single AZ
* Multiple AZ

Data transfer
* No charge for inbound data transfer
* Tiered charges for outbound data transfer

# Section 2: Amazon DynamoDB
## Realtion vs non-relation DB
![](https://i.imgur.com/Odb7clA.png)

## What is Amazon DynamoDB ?
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
Fast and flexibe NoSQL db service for any scale
</div>
* NoSQL db tables
    * Can be scaled
    * Create tables and add items
* Global tables
    * Automatically replicates choices across AWS regions
* Virtually unlimited storage
* Items can have differing attributes
    * Don't have to migrate schema
* Low-latency queries
* Scalable read/write throughput
* Store data accross multiples facilities
    * fault-toleratn architecture
    * stored in SSDs
    * encrypt data at rest
    * set time to live
* Automatically partitions data

## Amazon DynamoDB core components
* Tables, itmes and attributes
* DynamoDB supports 2 different kinds of primary keys
    * Partition key
    * Sort key

## Items in a table must have a key

# Section 3: Amazon Redshift
## Amazon Redshift
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
Fast, fully managed data warehouse, simple and cost-effective to analyze data using SQL and business intellignec tools.
</div>

## Introduction to Amazon Redshift
![](https://i.imgur.com/Uy8L1TQ.png)

* Fast and fully-managed data warehouse
* Pay for what you use
* Complex analytics queries
    * Parallel processing
    * Only seconds

## Parallel processing architecture
![](https://i.imgur.com/CSX2p5Z.png)

## Automation and scaling
Automate
* manage
* monitor
* scale

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" markdown="1">
Security is built-in with encryption of data.
</div>

## Compatibility
* Supports standard SQL
    * Connect with SQL clients
* Java connectivity
* Open DB connectivity
* Interact direclty with AWS CLI or management console

## Amazon Redshift use cases
* Enterprise data warehouse (EDW)
    * Migrate at a pace that customers are comfortable with
    * Experiment without large upfront cost or commitment
    * Respond faster to business needs
* Big data
    * Low price point for small customers
    * Managed service for ease of deployment and maintenance
    * Focus more on data and less on database management
* SaaS
    * Scale the data warehouse capacity as demand grows
    * Add analytic functionality to app
    * Reduce hardware and software costs

# Section 4: Amazon Aurora
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
MySQL and PostreSQL compatible relational db built for the cloud.
</div>

* Enterprise-class relational db
* Compatible with MySQL or PostgreSQL
* Automate time-consuming tasks (such as provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, failure detection and repair)
* Can reduce db costs

## Amazon Aurora service benefits
* Fast and available
* Managed service
* Simple
* Pay-as-you-go
* Compatible

## High availability
* Storing multiple copies through different AZ
* Data backed up to Amazon S3
* Use up to 15 read replica

## Resilient design
* Instant crash recovery
* Does not need to replay the redo log
    * Do it on every read operation
* Removes the buffer cache from the db process
